Crab cakes come in so many different shapes, sizes, and flavor profiles. This Miso Mayo Crab Cake uses a homemade miso mayo I posted some time ago. You can get that recipe here "[Miso Mayo][0]".  It gives the crab cake an excellent miso flavor with undertones of ginger. The typical crab cake is composed of crab meat and other various ingredients, such as breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, eggs, and seasonings. The crab cakes are either sautéed, baked, grilled or broiled. If Miso is not your thing, try wasabi/ chipotle mayo or a mayo of your choice.  Crab cakes are very versatile.

**_Ingredients_**

* 1 ½  tablespoon Miso Mayo ([Recipe here][0])
* 1 pound Lump Crab Meat
* ½ tablespoon Panko Bread Crumps for mixture
* 1 to 2 cups extra panko bread crumbs for breading
* Sesame seeds
* Pepper to taste (you don't need salt because there is saltiness from the miso)
* Add jalapeno or serrano peppers for an extra kick
* Chopped Green Onion/ Scallions
* Serve with Sambal, Siracha, and or a Squeeze of Lemon Juice

**_Directions_**

Combine in miso mayo, chopped green onions, panko bread crumbs, pepper, sesame seeds and gently fold mixture together until all ingredients are mixed well. Be careful not to break apart the crab meat too much. Shape into six crab cakes about ½ cup each. I like to use a ramekin to form my crab cakes.

Preheat a large nonstick pan to medium heat and coat with coconut oil.

Before you cook the crab cakes coat them with additional panko bread crumbs.

When the oil is hot, place crab cakes in pan and cook until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes per side. Serve as soon as possible. If you are going to save for later, put in the fridge immediately.

Garnish with scallions and sambal.
