Miso broths are one of the easiest broths one can make, and the soups allow for so many variations. According to Wikipedia; Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of a stock called "dashi" into which softened miso paste is mixed. Many ingredients are added depending on regional and seasonal recipes, and personal preferences.

Miso is made from fermented soybeans and some grain like rice or barley. The choice of miso paste you use will set the foundation of the flavor profile. Miso pastes come in red, white, yellow, and black. The darker the color, the longer it's gone through the fermentation process and the stronger it will taste. I prefer the red miso paste for my broths. It provides a strong miso flavor but isn't overbearing. Miso is something you can store in your fridge in an airtight container for 9 -12 months. It makes a great pantry item.

Dashi is a staple in Japanese stock and is used as a base for soups and sauces. Dashi is made from dried kelp, dried bonito flakes, dried small sardines, or dried shiitake mushrooms. I like to use the Ajinomoto Hon-Dashi (Bonito Fish Soup Stock) brand and occasionally bonito flakes.

**_The basic miso broth for one serving_**

* 1Â½ tsp dashi powderAjinomoto Hon-Dashi (Bonito Fish Soup Stock)
* One small piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
* 1 tbsp of miso paste (any kind)
* 2 tbsp mirin
* 3 cups of water

**_Directions_:**

In a pot add grated ginger, mirin, dashi powder and water to a boil.

Once the water reaches a rolling boil add miso paste.

Simmer for a few minutes until the miso is dissolved and the water becomes cloudy

At this point, you can add what you like to the soup, tofu, veggies, etc.

This is a basic way to make miso broths, but keep in mind making this soup can be very personalized.

Here is my Culinary Addictions version of a miso broth for two servings

* 4 tsp dashi powder
* 2 small pieces fresh ginger, peeled and grated
* 2 tbsp of miso paste (any kind)
* 3 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 6 cups of water
* 2 tbsp of sesame oil
* 2 cloves of garlic minced
* 1 quarter of a small onion minced

_**Directions:**_  
In a pot add sesame oil and lightly saute grated ginger, minced onion, and garlic  
Add dashi powder and water and bring to a boil  
Once the water reaches a rolling boil add miso paste.  
Simmer for a few minutes until the miso is dissolved and the water becomes cloudy  
At this point, you can add what you like to the soup, tofu, veggies, etc.

I prefer to cook my vegetable noodles, and meats separate from the broth and bring it all together in a bowl before serving/ eating. These soups are easy to make, and I like to take advantage of what may remain in my fridge. My favorite ingredients to add are ramen type noodles, bak choi, diakon, jalapeno, bean sprouts, green onion, and dried seaweed.
