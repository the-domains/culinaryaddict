I am a big fan of blue cheese. It wasn't until my late 20's I came across some good Danish blue cheese before I realized there is a wider range of blue cheeses out there.  Before then all my pallet knew of blue cheese was from blue cheese dressing or the occasional crumbles in a salad at a restaurant, particularly from Outback Steakhouse where my girlfriend at the time worked. She would hook up those cob salads with blue cheese crumbles for me.

Here is one of my favorite go-to recipes for a blue cheese dip that has dill in it. It's very easy to make.

* 1 cup of sour cream
* ¾ cup of mayonnaise
* ¼ cup of chopped fresh dill
* ¾ cup of blue cheese (I recommend the Danish blue)

Mix all ingredients in a blow until desired consistency. Personally, I prefer it chunky.
